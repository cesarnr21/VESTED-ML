Here is another guide to learn ML: [A guide for High School students to learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/kjaisingh/high-school-guide-to-machine-learning)

## Step 1: Learn how to program in Python
Python is the language of Machine Learning so you will need to learn it. Here is a resource I personally used to [learn Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) 

Here is another course you can take to cover most of the basics. [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017_2/home)

You will need to use to an Interactive Development Environment(IDE) to write and run your code. Here is a good free and online one. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

It is very important that you have a good foundation on programming in general before moving on.

## Step 2: Take some basic Machine Learning Courses
Here is a course that can teach you most of the basics and help you get started with more complex areas of [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This is a College Level course, so do not feel discouraged if it is hard to follow along.

## Step 3: Math Classes
Advanced Machine Learning will require a good understanding of math concepts. Here are some courses on Khan Academy that I recommend going through.

- [AP/College Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)
- [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [AP/College Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab)

There is not need to memorize every detail, but gain a solid foundation.

## Step 4: Become Part of Some online Communities.
I find that the [Learn Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/) and [Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) communities on Reddit are very good places to find more learning resources. Also, these are places where you can ask questions and get lots of help.

## Step 5: Make your own Project
The best way to learn programming and Machine Learning is to make your own projects. The truth that is that there is little you will know after watching hundreds of videos and you have not made your own models. Start small and then work your way up to more complex projects. Also, those reddit communities I mentioned earlier are also good places to get ideas for projects.

## Do not get discouraged and keep learning
It will take you a lot of time and practice in order to become a good Machine Learning Engineer, it will not happen overnight. It is important to understand that there is always more to learn, whether you graduate college with a degree in Computer Science, or you get a job at Google as a Machine Learning Engineer.
